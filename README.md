FamiChain is an aggregate project belonging to the Fami Cross-chains project chain of FamiChain Limited. The project prepared more than 8 months ago with the official launch from a team of 39 employees on April 28, 2022.

At FamiChain, there are currently 3 main products: FamiSocial (Web3 Social Network), FamiTrack (Crptocurrency Information Tracking) and FamiWallet (Cross-chains wallet). Currently, only the FamiSocial project is running a test (officially receiving whitelisting applications) and the other 2 projects have officially launched.

Also we will launch FamiMidMan (Escrow Platform) and FamiPay (part of FamiWallet but with integrated Fiat functionality) in the next quarter of 2022.

These are the main points of the project:
- FamiSocial: All users have the ability to own NFT for themselves as well as confirm the owner of individual/organization/community creative products. This social network is similar to Facebook, Twitter,... but we support the Cryptocurrency system inside. Turn everything into NFT and the system automatically rewards 24/24 for active users to promote promote the development of the platform.
- FamiTrack: This is a project that gets data directly from Coingecko and Coinmarketcap, we also develop an automatic system to identify new coins as well as AI to evaluate projects based on more than 20 criteria such as Contract, Community, Volume,...
- FamiWallet: This is a wallet system developed specifically for the future development of FamiChain's Crosschains system. It is now possible to synchronize all payments in the BTC, ERC20 and BEP20 networks thanks to the Sharing Pools system of FamiChain and its partners. Helps promote 24/7 liquidity as well as Cryptocurrency diversity and coverage.
